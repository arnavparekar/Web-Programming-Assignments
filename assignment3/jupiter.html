<p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun, and the largest in the solar system â€“ more than twice as massive as the other planets combined.
    If Jupiter was a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside. Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system, taking only 10.5 hours to spin around once on its axis.
